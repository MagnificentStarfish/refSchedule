ts-node graphqlServer.ts (server)
ts-node server.ts (database)


1. Set up your project: You've already created your refSchedule directory with frontend and backend subdirectories.

2. Backend setup: Navigate to the backend directory. Initialize a new Node.js project by running npm init -y (or npm init for manual setup). Install Express.js and GraphQL libraries by running npm install express express-graphql graphql.

3. GraphQL schema: Create a new file for your GraphQL schema. Define types for Referee, Game, and Location, and define queries for fetching data.

4. GraphQL resolvers: Create a new file for your resolvers. Implement functions for handling your GraphQL queries.

5. Express.js server: Create a new file for your server. Set up an Express.js server and use the express-graphql middleware to connect your GraphQL schema and resolvers.

6. Test your API: Install the Postman extension in Visual Studio Code. Use it to send requests to your GraphQL API and check the responses.

7. Frontend setup: Navigate to the frontend directory. Create a new React.js application by running npx create-react-app .. Install the Apollo Client library by running npm install @apollo/client.

8. 9. React components: Create React components for displaying referees, games, and locations. Use Apollo Client to fetch data from your GraphQL API.

10. Authentication: Back in your backend directory, install Passport.js by running npm install passport. Implement authentication in your Express.js server.

11. Connect frontend and backend: In your React application, use Apollo Client to send authenticated requests to your GraphQL API.



Thank you for providing the context. Here's a summary of your project:

You're working on a basketball game scheduling application. The application is responsible for scheduling referees for basketball games. The scheduling is based on several factors:

Proximity to the location: The application considers the distance between the referee's location and the game location. The maxTravelDistance property in the User model likely represents the maximum distance a referee is willing to travel for a game.

Skill level: The application also considers the referee's skill level when scheduling games. The proficiency property in the User model likely represents this.

Availability: The application checks the referee's availability to ensure they are free to referee the game. The availability property in the User model likely represents this.

The application is built with TypeScript and uses Mongoose for MongoDB object modeling. The User.ts file you've shared defines a User model, which represents a referee in the application. The model includes properties for the referee's first name, last name, email, address, profile picture, maximum travel distance, proficiency level, availability, and the games they are assigned to.

In future sessions, you can refer to this summary to provide context about your project.
